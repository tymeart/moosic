I guess I'm having trouble trying to figure out the structure of this app. It took a while for me to figure out how I should go about actually authorizing Spotify without a backend. Decided to make the first call as a link on the login page. Still trying to figure out how to do the POST request to get the access token and where and when that call should happen.
